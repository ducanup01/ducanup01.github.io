# Header for my page

**First of all**, we *need* to start somewhere right?

This is how my website starts. By learning to write markdown.

To do list:
1. Create a personal website.
2. Develop it overtime.
3. Note that this is public and stuff need to be done neat and nicely.

- Me in 1 year will make this website exceptional
- If you're reading this in October 2026 and it's not then I'm not good
- ok bai

1. I wonder if the numbered list still continues
2. ok

I need to highlight these ==very important tasks==.

Doesn't seem like highlighting is working

4. What about now
5. ha

- [x] task 1 checked
- [ ] task 2 unchecked
- [x] task 3 checked

H~2~O stay hydrated X^2^

Next up we create a table
|Header1|Header2|Header3|Header4|
|---|---|---|---|
|Number 1|Number 2|Number 3|Number 4|

This line should have a footnote [^firstlink]

Second line with a footnote [^secondlink]

Just dont put spaces in reference link

[^firstlink]: My first reference

[^secondlink]: Idk what prefixing with 2 lines means and im not doing it
